# CAL - Vaccine Router


## Description  

The purpose of this project is to distribute vaccines from 
a set of storage centers to a set of application centres 
minimizing the number of vehicles used without exceeding the 
vaccines conservation time.

The main concepts used for the development of this project are 
the **Travelling Salesman Problem**, **Vehicle Routing Problem** 
and the **Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem**.

This project was developed by Diogo Luís Henriques Costa 
(up201906731@edu.fe.up.pt), Francisco José Barbosa Marques 
Colino (up201905405@edu.fe.up.pt) and Rui Filipe Teixeira 
Alves (up201905853@edu.fe.up.pt) for
[CAL 2020-21](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=459479).
